**Technical Video Speech:**

"Hello, my name is Jerry Xing from set D, and I believe I deserve 90% on this project because my custom game, **MinecraftItem**, is creative and functional, my **WordGame** passes all tests, and my **NumberGame** has a fully working GUI.

Let me show you the file structure of my project. Here are the main classes:

- **AbstractGame.java**: An abstract class implementing the Game interface with basic game statistics.
- **Game.java**: The Game interface.
- **WordGame.java**: Implements the Word Game where users answer geography trivia questions, supported by **Country.java** and **World.java**.
- **NumberGame.java** and **NumberGameApp.java**: These provide the Number Game with a fully functional GUI.
- **MinecraftItem.java**: My custom game where players craft items based on Minecraft recipes. It includes classes like **GameController.java**, **CraftingItem.java**, **MaterialItem.java**, **ItemFactory.java**, and **Recipe.java**.

Let me shows how the project runs. Running **Main.java**, you're presented with a menu to select a game:

- Choosing **'W'** starts the **WordGame**, where you answer questions about countries and capitals. The game tracks your score and checks for high scores.
- Choosing **'N'** starts the **NumberGame**, featuring a GUI where you place numbers in ascending order on a grid. It provides feedback and score tracking.
- Choosing **'M'** starts **MinecraftItem**, where you craft items by placing materials on a crafting grid. The game checks your recipes, offers feedback, and keeps score.

All functionalities are complete, and each game works as intended.

Thank you for your time."
